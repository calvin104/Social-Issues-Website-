				<h3>Need for cheap healthy food</h3>
				<p>We need cheap affordable healthy food for everyone. Too much ugly produce which is food that is perfectly good for consumptionis thrown away each year by companies.<br> <br>

COSMETIC:
"Grocery stores want food that looks beautiful and unblemished on the outside, which means that they don't want ugly food, like scarred fruits and vegetables, almonds with minor insect damage on the skin and apples blemished by the rough winter. They have to wait for a juicer or processor to show interest or else they might go to waste". <br> <br>

OFF-SPEC:
"Certain types of food can fall through the cracks of our food system if it doesn't meet the strict specifications set by the buyer. Many of these variances are caused by the way the food is harvested or packaged. These products will typically not have a local buyer and need to be shipped far away in order for the farmer or producer to recoup the value or be forced to sell the product for much less". <br> <br>

SURPLUS/EXCESS INVENTORY:
"Due to the unpredictable nature of how bountiful a harvest can be or how over-forecasted production can be in any given year, a farmer or producer might find themselves with way more than they had planned for. The market can also be flooded with a particular category of trendy food, or a buyer can back out of a large order, leaving hard-working farmers and producers with perfectly good food that suddenly has no future".<br> <br>

UNDERVALUED:
"Perfectly good food goes to waste every day simply because there isn’t enough demand for it. For example, our broccoli leaves are a healthy and delicious part of the broccoli plant that used to get left in the field because stores only wanted to buy broccoli crowns–even though the stalk and leaves are over 2/3 of the plant"! <br> <br>

PACKAGING CHANGE:
"Brands, like people, sometimes need a makeover. However, when a brand changes the packaging on one of their products, an unintended consequence is that the old packaging is often stuck in food purgatory. It's what's on the inside that counts, right? That's why we recover these foods so that they are enjoyed by our customers - no matter how they look on the outside". <br> <br>

SHORT-CODED:
"Traditional retail stores won’t stock items with expiration dates less than a few months away. To help close the loop on this needless source of food waste, we source products that are "short-coded" so they can find a good home instead of being stranded in a warehouse. We’re able to offer a more flexible solution than grocery stores and our customers get a great deal on their favorite products"!

"Elliott is one of 40,000 volunteers who gave their time this year to help the Food Bank in its mission to end hunger in San Francisco and Marin. That’s the equivalent of 70 full-time employees, and every last person is needed to distribute just over 48 million pounds this year". <br> <br>

"A volunteer shift is fast-paced and exciting. Many of our warehouse shifts involve boxing up thousands of pounds of fruits or vegetables. Sometimes our volunteers are tasked with repacking rice into family-friendly one-pound bags. Every volunteer leaves knowing just how much they packed or sorted, and how much of an impact it will make on the community later that week".
