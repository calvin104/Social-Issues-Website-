Code Tenderloin Final Website Project

I am very proud of having this line of code below, which links my page 1, 2 , 3 together and having the pages at the very top left 
of my page and also the very bottom left of my page which helps people navigate easily between pages.

    <a href="#">Page 1</a>
		<a href="finalp2.html">Page 2</a>
		<a href="finalp3.html">Page 3</a>
